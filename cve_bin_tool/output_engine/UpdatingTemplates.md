# How to customise HTML Report Design? 
CVE Binary Tool provides HTML Report as an output type and although the Report design will work for most of the users it might be the case that you want to update the Report Design according to your needs. So in this tutorial, we will be discussing on how to customise the HTML Report.

> This guide assumes that you are using the version `1.0+` of cve-bin-tool.
> We recommend using the latest version.

## Setting up the directory
Before we start customising HTML Report we have to set up a templates directory to work on. To set up directory we have to move to the directory where we want to create the directory then create a new directory with the name `templates` and move inside that folder. 

**steps to setup directory:**
1) Move to the directory where you want to create the directory. I will create a new directory `my_templates` because I want to store my customised templates there.
```console
user@ubuntu: ~$ mkdir my_templates
user@ubuntu: ~$ cd my_templates/
```
2) Create a new directory `templates`  and move inside this directory. Please note you must specify the name of the directory to be `templates`  or it will not work.
```console
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates$ mkdir templates
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates$ cd templates/

# Actual Path After the Steps
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates$ 
```
This will set up our templates directory and now we are ready to start customising the HTML Report.

## Setting up the Files
Now as we have set up our templates directory we will create files that are needed for the HTML report. CVE Binary Tool uses `Jinja` as its templating engine. HTML Report will need 4 basic templates that are as follows:
1) base.html
2) dashboard.html
3) row_cve.html
4) row_product.html

These files will control the actual structure of the report. We'll discuss in detail on what things we need to consider while creating these files and we'll also discuss that which files correspond to which part. But before that let's create those files.

So we'll need a directory named `html` to  store that files. 
```console 
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates$ mkdir html && cd html
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates/html$
```

I'll create those files using terminal but you can create them by any method.
```console
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates/html$ touch base.html
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates/html$ touch dashboard.html
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates/html$ touch row_cve.html
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates/html$ touch row_product.html
``` 
We can confirm that using `ls` in the current directory
```console
user@ubuntu: ~/my_templates/templates/html$ ls
base.html 
dashboard.html
row_cve.html
row_product.html
```
Now we'll discuss each file in detail and see what is the role of each of that file and how to customise that.

### row_cve.html
---------------------
#### Role:
Each product in the scan will have one or more CVE associated with it and `row_cve.html` will have the representational design. It will hold the information about how a particular CVE is displayed
#### How to customise?
As such, there is no limitation on how to customise `base.html` but we need to handle some jinja variables otherwise it will not render properly.
Here is the list of jinja variables and functionality they provide.
| Jinja Variables  | Implementation | Function  |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| {{ date }} | optional       | date of report generation |
| {{ script_plotly}} | required | JavaScript File for Plotly.js which is needed for Graph Generation |
| {{ style_bootstrap}} | required  | bootstrap CSS file |
| {{ style_main }} | optional | Your own CSS implementation|
|{{ dashboard  }} | required| This will contain the `dashboard.html` in rendered form |
|{{products_found}}| required  | This will have all the products that are found during the scan and rendered in `product_cve.html`
|{{script_jquery}}| required | JQuery.js file | 
|{{script_bootstrap}}| required | Bootstrap.js file |
    
> {{ script_plotly }} must be included at the top before any other JavaScript file. Other script files can be included as per your preference.

 For more help, you can take a look at cve-bin-tool's own `base.html`  template implementation.  

### base.html
---------------------
#### Role:
As the name suggests `base.html` is the actual base for the template and it will include the result of other templates that are being rendered. It also holds all the JavaScript and CSS files.
#### How to customise?
As such, there is no boundation on how to customise `base.html` but we need to handle some jinja variables otherwise it will not render properly.
Here is the list of jinja variables and functionality they provide.
| Jinja Variables  | Implementation | Function  |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| {{ date }} | optional       | date of report generation |
| {{ script_plotly}} | required | JavaScript File for Plotly.js which is needed for Graph Generation |

|{{products_found}}| required  | This will have all the products that are found during the scan and rendered in `product_cve.html`
|{{script_jquery}}| required | JQuery.js file | 
|{{script_bootstrap}}| required | Bootstrap.js file |
