Adding a new checker to the cve-bin-tool
========================================

## Requirements

In order to add a new checker to the CVE-bin-tool, one must provide a checker
file.  See any checker in the `checkers/` directory as an example.

Currently, a checker must provide one class which inherits Checker class of
the checkers module. class name of the checker must be same as filename of the 
checker with `Checker` suffix at the end. Ex: if you are creating a checker for
`curl` binary then filename of checker should be `curl.py` and class definition
should be:
```python
from cve_bin_tool.checkers import Checker

class CurlChecker(Checker):
```

Every checker must contain following 4 class attributes specific to product(ex: curl) 
you are making checker for:
1. CONTAINS_PATTERNS - list of commonly found strings in the binary of the product
2. FILENAME_PATTERNS - list of different filename for the product
3. VERSION_PATTERNS - list of version patterns found in binary of the product.
4. VENDOR_PRODUCT - list of vendor product pairs for the product as they appear in
NVD.

`CONTAINS_PATTERN`, `FILENAME_PATTERNS` and `VERSION_PATTERNS` supports regex to cover
wide range of use cases.

Once the checker is added, its name should also be added to `__init__.py` (so
that `from modules import *` will find it).

## Hints for finding the right data to use

### Finding a version pattern

The VERSION_PATTERNS contains strings which will be used as a signature for
determining the version of the product that is present in the system. You should
keep in mind that these strings should be consistent across all versions of the 
binary and in as many software distributions as possible.

You can get a basic idea of the pattern from looking at the project's documentation/website
or use [cvedetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/) since it catalogs vulnerable versions and
thus has version lists. Once you know what the version numbers look like, you'll need to 
find them in the code or the binary itself to make sure you've got a findable pattern.

A few ways to do it:

- The CVE Binary tool basically works by running the command line utility `strings` on a file,
  so if you have a local copy of the library, you can run `strings $libraryname` and see what
  comes out.  try `strings $libraryname | grep $version` and see what you find, and if you
  don't find it that way `strings $libraryname | less` and page through (maybe run a filter
  in there so it's only strings over a certain size?)

- If you don't have a copy, browse through the source to find the version string. It's usually
  helpfully named something like 'version' so a quick grep/search often will turn it up, and
  if you know the latest version number (usually proudly mentioned in the latest news post
  or similar) you can grep for that and then look at the history to see what valid patterns
  look like.

### Avoiding false positives (beware the X.X.X version pattern!)

It can be very tempting to have a version pattern that matches `X.X.X` where `X` is a number
(or in regex form: `r"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"`).  But beware! There are lots of other
libraries potentially compiled in to your binary that will match `X.X.X`.  The one you're
most likely going to see is glibc, the standard c library.

For an example, here's a list of some of the "interesting" version-like strings from one
of our binary test files:

```
~/Code/cve-bin-tool$ strings test/binaries/test-png-unknown.out
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
libc.so.6
GLIBC_2.2.5
This program is designed to test the cve-bin-tool checker.
It outputs a few strings normally associated with png 1.6.36.
They appear below this line.
------------------
Application uses deprecated png_write_init() and should be recompiled
GCC: (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0
printf@@GLIBC_2.2.5
__libc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.2.5
```

As you can see, there's a lot of things that will match `X.X.X`:

* glibc is version 2.2.5
* gcc is version 7.4.0
* Ubuntu is 18.04.1

So you want something that makes the version string a little more precise to the
product you're looking for.  For example, if we were *intentionally* looking for
glibc (as in, writing a glibc checker), we could use the string `GLIBC_` or 
`@@GLIBC_` as a prefix and get a regex that would tell us about glibc without 
also telling us the GCC and Ubuntu versions.

So a good regex signature for GLIBC might be `r"@@GLIBC_[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"`

The whole point of the CVE Binary Tool is to detect libraries that you might not
know are there, so we'd expect it often to be used on binaries that have a lot
of libraries compiled into them.  Finding a regex that detects only what you
care about even in the face of a lot of similar strings is essential for us to
avoid false positives.

It's also worth noting that sometimes there just aren't great version strings
available: sometimes `X.X.X` is all you can find.  If you get stuck at this
point, please make a note of it in the 
[New Checker](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22new+checker%22)
issue if there is one. (You can make a new one and note it there if there isn't.)
That helps other contributors know that that particular checker is going to be
hard to do.  Once you've done that, you can abandon the checker and find something
easier to work on, or you can try to think outside the box to find another way
to detect the version.  One example is how we did it for the 
[sqlite3 get_version_map() fuction](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/cve_bin_tool/checkers/sqlite.py#L104)
where the checker uses version hashes from the website that are *also* stored
as strings in the binary.

### Finding FILENAME_PATTERNS

The FILENAME_PATTERNS contains the names of the files in the binary where the above 
signatures were found. If there are more than one place where the version strngs are
found, please make sure that you add all the filenames.


### Choosing contains patterns to detect the library
contains patterns are the string pattern that you commonly found in the binary of the
product you are looking for. You want a signature that hasn't changed in a large 
number of versions so you'll detect the library as long as possible (and if you
notice that it did change before some version date, you can always add more
strings to improve the coverage).  If you have a copy of the library you can
run `strings $libraryname` to find some candidate strings that look good,
then you should look at their source repository to see when those strings
were added and if they were changed.  (there's a 'history' button on github
for this, or other tools for other repositories). `CONTAINS_PATTERNS` field supports
regex pattern so you can use creative signature which remain same for number of 
versions.
> Note: We by default include VERSION_PATTERNS as a valid CONTAINS_PATTERNS

You can find these by-

```console
$ strings (path of the binary) | grep -i (product_name)
```

### Quickstart for finding patterns

What often helps is trying to find an `.rpm` (or more than one) or a package
which contains the product you're looking for.

Searching on https://pkgs.org is a good place to start.

For this example we'll be using `libvorbis`: https://pkgs.org/search/?q=libvorbis

In the below example we picked fedora 33's package for version 1.3.7 of
libvorbis. We can extract the `.rpm` file using a combintation of
[rpm2cpio and cpio](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-to-extract-an-rpm-package-without-installing-it.html)
or using [rpmfile](https://pypi.org/project/rpmfile/). Sometimes you'll have
packages which come in `.deb` or .`tar` files.

- `.deb` files can be extracted with `ar x somefile.deb && tar xvf data.tar.xz`

- `.tar` files can be extrated using `tar`

```console
$ curl -sfL 'https://download-ib01.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/33/Everything/x86_64/os/Packages/l/libvorbis-1.3.7-2.fc33.x86_64.rpm' | rpmfile -xv -
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib/.build-id/02/980384bc359497f0121fc74974e465ba7e29aa
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib/.build-id/1c/ff0ed918467a6224a5108793bf779e61486151
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib/.build-id/75/8407ea857c63ae42c4d9959ad252de6fb9bcca
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib64/libvorbis.so.0
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib64/libvorbis.so.0.4.9
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib64/libvorbisenc.so.2
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib64/libvorbisenc.so.2.0.12
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib64/libvorbisfile.so.3
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/lib64/libvorbisfile.so.3.3.8
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/share/doc/libvorbis/AUTHORS
/tmp/tmp.U3wkntEqtD/usr/share/licenses/libvorbis/COPYING
```

Then look for which files you downloaded are binaries or libraries. We can use
the `file` command combined with the `find` command for this. The `find`
command will list every file in the directory we proivde to it (`.` in this
case) and execute any program we want using that filename. In this case we want
to run the `file` command on each file we get from `find`.

We want to filter the output using `grep` to show us only executables (programs
you run) and shared objects (libaries programs use) using
`-E 'executable,|shared object,'` which is a regex which says to show lines that
`find` output if they have either `executable,` or `shared object,` in them.

The final `tee` command in combination with `sed` is creating a new file called
`executables.txt` which has all the filenames in it. It does this by only
writing what comes before the `:` to the file that was in the output of the
`grep` command which looked for executables.

```console
$ find . -exec file {} \; | grep -E 'executable,|shared object,' | tee >(sed -e 's/:.*//g' > executables.txt)
./usr/lib64/libvorbisfile.so.3.3.8: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=1cff0ed918467a6224a5108793bf779e61486151, stripped
./usr/lib64/libvorbisenc.so.2.0.12: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=02980384bc359497f0121fc74974e465ba7e29aa, stripped
./usr/lib64/libvorbis.so.0.4.9: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=758407ea857c63ae42c4d9959ad252de6fb9bcca, stripped
```

You'll want to run strings on those binaries and do a case insensitive search
for the package name using `grep -i`.

```console
$ strings $(cat executables.txt) | sort | uniq | grep -i libvorbis
3?Xiph.Org libVorbis 1.3.7
libvorbisenc.so.2
libvorbisenc.so.2.0.12-1.3.7-2.fc33.x86_64.debug
libvorbisfile.so.3
libvorbisfile.so.3.3.8-1.3.7-2.fc33.x86_64.debug
libvorbis.so.0
libvorbis.so.0.4.9-1.3.7-2.fc33.x86_64.debug
Xiph.Org libVorbis I 20200704 (Reducing Environment)
```

You also might want to look for the version number. In this case it's `1.3.7`.

```console
$ strings $(cat executables.txt) | sort | uniq | grep -i 1.3.7
3?Xiph.Org libVorbis 1.3.7
libvorbisenc.so.2.0.12-1.3.7-2.fc33.x86_64.debug
libvorbisfile.so.3.3.8-1.3.7-2.fc33.x86_64.debug
libvorbis.so.0.4.9-1.3.7-2.fc33.x86_64.debug
```

In this case the most interesting line in the output of the above two commands
is `3?Xiph.Org libVorbis 1.3.7`. We can probably use this to create a regex for
`VERSION_PATTERNS`.

That regex might look like this: `3\?Xiph.Org libVorbis ([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)`

### Finding Vendor Product pairs

Every checker class must contain the vendor and product name pair(s)
as they appear in NVD. The best way to do this is to search the cached sqlite
database of the NVD using a CVE you want to know the vendor product pair(s) for.

```console
$ sqlite3 ~/.cache/cvedb/cve.db \
    "SELECT vendor, product FROM cve_range WHERE CVE_Number='CVE-2016-0718';" \
    | sed -e 's/|/, /g' -e 's/^/VPkg\: /'
VPkg: apple, mac_os_x
VPkg: canonical, ubuntu_linux
VPkg: debian, debian_linux
VPkg: libexpat, expat
VPkg: mozilla, firefox
VPkg: opensuse, leap
VPkg: suse, linux_enterprise_debuginfo
```

`VENDOR_PRODUCT` attribute should have list of tuples of vendor product pair
found in the listings. Some of the listings will be with regards to products
that include this product. For our example all listings except 
`libexpat, expat` mearly include the target product (`expat` for the
example SQL query).

### For PyPI packages

Reading through the above sections before this section is highly recommended.

1. `CONTAINS_PATTERN` can be any unique string in the whole package and can be found through the same process as in **Choosing contains patterns to detect the library**.
2. `FILENAME_PATTERNS` should be `[r"METADATA", r"PKG-INFO"]`.
3. `VERSION_PATTERNS` should be `[r"--generated pattern for cve-bin-tool Name: <package-name> Version: ([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)"]`. The strings in `METADATA` and `PKG-INFO` are converted similar to above string for version pattern detection.  
 Note: The version pattern can change depending on the version convention of the package
5. `VENDOR_PRODUCT` can be found through the same process as in **Finding Vendor Product pairs section**.

## Adding tests
There are two types of tests you want to add to prove that your checker works as expected:

1. Test to show that the cve mapping works as expected.  
2. Tests to show that the checker correctly detects real binaries.

You can read about how to add these in 
[tests/README.md](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/test/README.md)

## Running tests

To run the tests for `cve-bin-tool`

```console
python setup.py test
```

To run tests for a particular checker

```console
pytest -k $checkername
```

Alternatively you can run Long Tests using

```console
LONG_TESTS=1 pytest -k $checkername
```
You can run tests in parallel by using

```console
pytest -n 4
```
>This will spawn 4 worker processes to leverage multicore system.  
You can set an arbitrary number of workers. A good rule of thumb is to specify no. of workers equal to no. of cores.

## How it works

The CVE-bin-checker works by extracting strings from binaries and determining
if a given library has been compiled into the binary. For this, Checker class
contains two methods: 1) `guess_contains()` and 2) `get_version()`.

1. `guess_contains()` method takes list of extracted string lines as an input and 
return True if it finds any of the `CONTAINS_PATTERNS` on any line from the 
lines.
2. `get_version()` method takes list of extracted string lines and the filename as
inputs and returns information about whether the binary contains the library
in question, is a copy of the library in question, and if either of those are
true it also returns a version string. If the binary does not contain the
library, this function returns an empty dictionary.

If `curl` product is being scanned, `get_version()` method of CurlChecker will
return following dictionary.

```json
{
  "is_or_contains": "is",
  "modulename": "curl",
  "version": "6.41.0"
}
```

In most of the cases, Just providing above five class attributes will be enough.
But sometimes, you need to override this method to correctly detect version of 
the product. We have done this in the checkers of `python`, `sqlite` and `kerberos`.
