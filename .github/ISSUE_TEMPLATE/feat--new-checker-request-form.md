### Description

* Website: WEBSITE_LINK_OF_THE_PRODUCT
* CVEs: CVEDETAILS_PRODUCT_PAGE

Many older products may have multiple NVD CPE  {vendor, product} pairs associated with them. We can figure out one set from the CVE list above, but if you know of others that need to be added add them here:
* NVD CPE vendor(s): 
* NVD CPE products(s): 


### Checker creation links
Instructions: [How to add a new checker to the CVE Binary Tool](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/master/cve_bin_tool/checkers/README.md)

We also have a [checker creation helper script](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/cve_bin_tool/helper_script.py) that can get you started in making the checker.
