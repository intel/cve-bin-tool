### Description

Add a short description of the feature you'd like to have.

### Why?

Explain why this is important to you and why you think it's important to others.

### Environment context (optional)

We don't always know how people use CVE-bin-tool.  If it helps motivate your
feature request, feel free to explain where you run it and why here.

Some things that might be useful:
- Are you running cve-bin-tool on every pull request? before every release? Once a day? Once a week?
- Do you need to run in an offline environment?
- What form of output do you use?
- Do you store/share manipulate old reports?
- How do you handle triage and fixing of issues found?
- Do you need to support a specific operating system, cloud setup, version of python, runtime environment?


### Anything else?

Feel free to add any other context here.
