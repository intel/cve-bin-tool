Adding a new checker to the cve-bin-tool
========================================

In order to add a new checker to the CVE-bin-tool, one must provide a checker
file.  See any checker in the checkers/ directory as an example.

Currently, this checker must provide one function:

This function takes a version string for a given library and returns the lists
of CVEs that affect that version.

`get_version(lines, filename)`

The CVE-bin-checker works by extracting strings from binaries and determining
if a given library has been compiled into the binary.  This function takes as
input the extracted string lines and the filename and returns information about
whether the binary contains the library in question, is a copy of the library
in question, and if either of those are true it also returns a version string.
If the binary does not contain the library, this function returns an empty dict
structure.

The docstring of the function must contain the vendor and package name pair(s).

```python
def get_version(lines, filename):
    '''
    Description...

    VPkg: libexpat, expat
    VPkg: libexpat_project, libexpat
    '''
```

Once the checker is added, its name should also be added to __init__.py (so
that `from modules import *` will find it) and it should also be added to the
variable `module_list` in `cve-bin-tool.py` so that it will be run.
