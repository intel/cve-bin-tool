Adding a new checker to the cve-bin-tool
========================================

In order to add a new checker to the CVE-bin-tool, one must provide a checker
file.  See any checker in the `checkers/` directory as an example.

Currently, this checker must provide one function:

`get_version(lines, filename)`

The CVE-bin-checker works by extracting strings from binaries and determining
if a given library has been compiled into the binary.  This function takes as
input the extracted string lines and the filename and returns information about
whether the binary contains the library in question, is a copy of the library
in question, and if either of those are true it also returns a version string.
If the binary does not contain the library, this function returns an empty dict
structure.

The if the CLI for `curl` was scanned the output dict would look something like
this.

```json
{
  "is_or_contains": "is",
  "modulename": "curl",
  "version": "6.41.0"
}
```

The docstring of the function must contain the vendor and package name pair(s)
as they appear in NVD. The best way to do this is to search the cached sqlite
version of the NVD using a CVE you want to know the vendor package pair(s) for.

```console
$ sqlite3 ~/.cache/cve-bin-tool/nvd.vulnerabilities.db \
    "SELECT Vendor_Name, Product_Name FROM nvd_data WHERE CVE_Number='CVE-2016-0718';" \
    | sed -e 's/|/, /g' -e 's/^/VPkg\: /'
VPkg: apple, mac_os_x
VPkg: canonical, ubuntu_linux
VPkg: debian, debian_linux
VPkg: libexpat, expat
VPkg: mozilla, firefox
VPkg: opensuse, leap
VPkg: suse, linux_enterprise_debuginfo
```

The resulting docstring in `get_version` would have those `VPkg` listings at the
end of it. Some of the listings will be with regards to packages that include
this package. For our example all listings except `libexpat, expat` merely
include the target package (`expat` for the example SQL query).

```python
def get_version(lines, filename):
    '''
    Description...

    VPkg: libexpat, expat
    '''
```

Once the checker is added, its name should also be added to __init__.py (so
that `from modules import *` will find it).

## Hints for finding the right data to use

### Finding a version pattern

You can get a basic idea of the pattern from looking at the project's documentation/website or use cvedetails since it catalogs vulnerable versions and thus has version lists. Once you know what the version numbers look like, you'll need to find them in the code or the binary itself to make sure you've got a findable pattern.

A few ways to do it:

- The CVE Binary tool basically works by running the command line utility `strings` on a file, so if you have a local copy of the library, you can run `strings $libraryname` and see what comes out.  try `strings $libraryname | grep $version` and see what you find, and if you don't find it that way `strings $libraryname | less` and page through (maybe run a filter in there so it's only strings over a certain size?)

- If you don't have a copy, browse through the source to find the version string.  It's usually helpfully named something like 'version' so a quick grep/search often will turn it up, and if you know the latest version number (usually proudly mentioned in the latest news post or similar) you can grep for that and then look at the history to see what valid patterns look like.

### Choosing a signature to detect the library
You want a signature that hasn't changed in a large number of versions so you'll detect the library as long as possible (and if you notice that it did change before some version date, you can always add more strings to improve the coverage).  If you have a copy of the library you can run `strings $libraryname` to find some candidate strings that look good, then you should look at their source repository to see when those strings were added and if they were changed.  (there's a 'history' button on github for this, or other tools for other repositories).

## Adding tests
There are two types of tests you want to add to prove that your checker works as expected:

1. Test to show that the cve mapping works as expected.  
2. Tests to show that the checker correctly detects real binaries.

You can read about how to add these in [tests/README.md](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/master/test/README.md)
