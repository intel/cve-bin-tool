Welcome to CVE Binary Tool's documentation!
===========================================

The CVE Binary Tool helps you determine if your system includes known vulnerabilities.  You can scan binaries for a number of common, vulnerable components (openssl, libpng, libxml2, expat and others), or if you know the components used, you can get a list of known vulnerabilities associated with a list of components and versions.
