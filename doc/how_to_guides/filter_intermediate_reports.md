# Filter Intermediate Reports

Let's consider a case where a user has multiple intermediate reports stored at a single path. But the user wants to merge only selected reports. We can do this by filtering intermediate reports based on the tag.

## How to filter Intermediate reports?

Suppose you have multiple intermediate reports stored at a single path.

```bash
path
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-02.01-17-48.json[weekly]
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-09.02-39-43.json[weekly]
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-16.23-44-35.json[weekly]
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-23.23-44-49.json[weekly]
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-24.23-45-08.json[daily]
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-25.23-45-08.json[daily]
└── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-26.23-45-08.json[daily]

0 directories, 7 files

```
Note: You can specify tags while generating intermediate reports using `-t --tag`. For this example, we have assumed that the intermediate reports contain tag {weekly or daily}

We want to merge the weekly generated report to plot the week-wise timeline trace as an HTML report. We can have some other use cases as well.      
To filter out the intermediate reports, use:
```
python -m cve_bin_tool.cli -F weekly -m /path -f html
```
This will generate a merged report from these files -

```
path
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-02.01-17-48.json[weekly]
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-09.02-39-43.json[weekly]
├── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-16.23-44-35.json[weekly]
└── intermediate.cve-bin-tool.2021-06-23.23-44-49.json[weekly]
```

Alternatively, users can filter out intermediate reports which are generated by multiple teams if they have specified distinguishable tags.
If we have intermediate reports {backend and frontend}. We can simply use:

```
python -m cve_bin_tool.cli -F backend -m /path 
```
This will generate a vulnerability report for all the backend related binaries.
