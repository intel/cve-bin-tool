# How do I use CVE Binary Tool in an offline environment?

The cve-bin-tool can be used in offline environments which do not have direct access to the internet to download the latest vulnerability databases.

## Prepare the vulnerability database for offline use
To download the vulnerability database for use in an offline environment, ensure that cve-bin-tool is installed on an internet-connected system.

Run the tool to obtain the latest version of the vulnerability database
```
$ cve-bin-tool --update now
```
NOTE The tool will error with InsufficientArgs because no directory was specified for a scan. This is expected behaviour.

## Transfer the vulnerability database file into a directory in the offline environment
The way of transfer depends on the environment. The files to be transferred are in "~/.cache/cve-bin-tool"

## Import the vulnerability database file on the offline system
The vulnerability database should be copied into ~/.cache/cve-bin-tool

## Run cve-bin-tool with --update never option
In an offline environment, when running a scan specify `--update never` so that cve-bin-tool doesn't attempt to download the latest database files.

## Maintenance Updates
In an offline environment, it is important to update the vulnerability database on a regular basis as often as you feel appropriate, so that the scanner can continue to detect recently-identified vulnerabilities. If any changes to CVE data is required (e.g. to remove false positives), you might also want to create and copy over a triage data file for usage.
