This file contains the tips/links I put into bugs marked "good first issue" so
that new contributors have the guidance they need right in the bug.

**Short tips for new contributors:**
* [cve-bin-tool's contributor docs](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* If you've contributed to open source but not this project, you might just want our [checklist for a great pull request](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#checklist-for-a-great-pull-request)
* cve-bin-tool uses https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ style for commit messages, and we have a test that checks the title of your PR.  A good potential title for this one is in the title of this issue.
* You can make an issue auto close by including a comment "fixes #ISSUENUMBER" in your PR comments where ISSUENUMBER is the actual number of the issue.
