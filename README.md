This tool scans for a number of common, vulnerable open source components
(openssl, libpng, libxml2, expat and a few others) to let you know if your
system includes common libraries with known vulnerabilities.

Usage:
`cve-bin-tool <flags> <path to directory>`

If you are using the CVE Binary Tool direct from source rather than installed as a package, you can do `python -m cve_bin_tool.cli <flags> <path to directory>`


    Possible output levels:
    -v (verbose): print scan results as they're found
       (regular): print only final summary
    -q (quiet):   suppress all output but exit with error
                  number indicating number of files with CVE

    Other options:
    -x (extract): Autoextract compressed files
    -m (multi-thread): Enable multithread mode for scanning and extracting
    -u (update): Update NVD database

When running this script, Python 3 is preferred over Python 2.7 because it has
been more tested, but both versions should work.

This readme is intended to be a quickstart guide for using the tool.  If you
require more information, there is also a [user manual](MANUAL.md) available.

How it works
------------

This scanner looks at the strings found in binary files to see if they
match certain vulnerable versions of the following libraries and tools:

* curl
* expat
* libnss
* node.js
* openssl
* libpng
* libtiff
* xerces
* xml2
* zlib

In the upcoming version, there will also be checkers for
* icu
* kerberos
* libgcrypt
* libjpeg
* sqlite
* systemd

You can try them out right now if you checkout the master branch rather than
the latest release.

All the checkers can be found in the checkers directory, as can the
[instructions on how to add a new checker](cve_bin_tool/checkers/README.md).
Support for new checkers can be requested via
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/issues).

Limitations
-----------

This scanner does not attempt to exploit issues or examine the code in greater
detail; it only looks for library signatures and version numbers.  As such, it
cannot tell if someone has backported fixes to a vulnerable version, and it
will not work if library or version information was intentionally obfuscated.

This tool is meant to be used as a quick-to-run, easily-automatable check in a
non-malicious environment so that developers can be made aware of old libraries
with security issues that have been compiled into their binaries.

Requirements
------------

To use the auto-extractor, you may need the following utilities depending on the
type of file you need to extract. Belows are required to run the full
test suite on linux:

* `ar`
* `cabextract`
* `cpio`
* `rpm2cpio`

Most of these are installed by default on many Linux systems, but `cabextract` and
`rpm2cpio` in particular might need to be installed.

On windows systems, you may need:

* `ar`
* `7z`
* `Expand`

Windows has `ar` and `Expand` installed in default, but `7z` in particular might need to be installed.

CSV2CVE
-------

The CVE Binary Tool package also includes a tool called `csv2cve` which is a helper tool that allows you to search the local database for a list of known packages.  This can be useful if the list of packages is known.

Usage:
`csv2cve <csv_file>`

The CSV file must contain the following columns: `vendor,package,version` where the vendor and package names are exact matches to the strings in the National Vulnerability Database.  You can read more about how to find the correct string in [the checker documentation](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/master/cve_bin_tool/checkers/README.md), and the [csv2cve manual](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/master/CSV2CVE.md) has more information on using this tool.

Feedback & Contributions
------------------------

Bugs and feature requests can be made via [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool).  Be aware that these issues are
not private, so take care when providing output to make sure you are not
disclosing security issues in other products.

Pull requests are also welcome via git.

The CVE Binary Tool uses [the Black python code
formatter](https://github.com/python/black) to keep coding style consistent;
you may wish to have it installed to make pull requests easier.

Security Issues
---------------

Security issues with the tool itself can be reported to Intel's security
incident response team via
[https://intel.com/security](https://intel.com/security).

If in the course of using this tool you discover a security issue with someone
else's code, please disclose responsibly to the appropriate party.
