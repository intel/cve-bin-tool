          The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage

          Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy
          of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work
          that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following
          the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where

          Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of

          rights of the rights owners in the Work, of the exhaustion
          of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

        Obligations of the Licensee
        <p>
          The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject
          to some restrictions and obligations imposed on
          the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
        </p>

        <p>
          Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright,
          patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the
          Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must
          include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every
          copy of the Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee
          must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating
          that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies
          of the Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or
          Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a
          later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly
          distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by
          communicating &apos;EUPL v. 1.2 only&apos;. The Licensee (becoming Licensor)
          cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work
          or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates
          Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work
          and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this
          Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of
          this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, &apos;Compatible
          Licence&apos; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached
          to this Licence. Should the Licensee&apos;s obligations under the
          Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this
          Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.
        </p>

        <p>
          Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating
          copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable
          copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this
          Source will be easily and freely available for as long as
          the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission
          to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
          names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable
          and customary use in describing the origin of the Work
          and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.
        </p>

      </li>

        <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 6.</var>
        Chain of Authorship
        <p>
          The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original
          Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her
          and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications
          he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her
          and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor
          and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their
          contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.

        <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 7.</var>
        Disclaimer of Warranty
        <p>
          The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by
          numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore
          contain defects or &apos;bugs&apos; inherent to this type of development.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on
          an &apos;as is&apos; basis and without warranties of any kind concerning
          the Work, including without limitation merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,
          accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights
          other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
        </p>

        <p>
          This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence
          and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.
        </p>

      </li>
      
<li>
        <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 8.</var>
        Disclaimer of Liability
        <p>
          Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused
          to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for
          any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind,
          arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including
          without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
          computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
          damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
          such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory
          product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
        </p>

        Additional agreements
        <p>
          While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
          agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this
          Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your
          own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the
          original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree
          to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
          liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor
          by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.

        Information to the public

          In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means
          of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering
          to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution
          channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide
          to the public the information requested by the applicable
          law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be

        Termination of the Licence

          The Licence and the rights granted hereunder
          will terminate automatically upon any breach
          by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person
          who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence,
          provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.

        <p>
          If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under
          applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability
          of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed
          or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

          The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or
