             accordance with Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Copyright
             Act, such as trademarks, patents and design rights,
             but this does not entail an impediment to use
             information where the licensor&apos;s logo has been
             permanently integrated into the information or to
             attribute the origin of the information in accordance
             with the article below relating to attribution.
          <p>If the licensor has made available information not
             covered by the licence according to the above list,
             the licensee must cease all use of the information
             under the licence, and erase the information as soon

          Effects of breach of the licence
            <br />

   The licence is subject to the licensee&apos;s compliance
                 with the terms and conditions of this licence.
                 In the event that the licensee commits a
                 breach of this licence, this will entail that
                 the licensee&apos;s right to use the information
                 will be revoked immediately without further
                 notice. In case of such a breach, the licensee
                 must immediately and without further notice
                 take measures to cause the infringement to
                 end. Because the right to use the information
                 has been terminated, the licensee must cease
                 all use of the information by virtue of the
                 licence.

          Attribution
            <br />

   The licensee shall attribute the licensor as
                 specified by the licensor and include a
                 reference to this licence. To the extent
                 practically possible, the licensee shall
                 provide a link to both this licence and the
                 source of the information.

          <p>If the licensor has not specified how attributions shall
             be made, the licensee shall normally state the
             following: «Contains data under the Norwegian licence
             for Open Government data (NLOD) distributed by [name
             of licensor]».</p>

            <p>If the licensor has specified that the information shall
             only be available under a specific version of this
             licence, cf. Section 10, the licensee shall also state
             this.</p>

            <p>If the information has been changed, the licensee must
             clearly indicate that changes have been made by the
             licensee.</p>

          Proper use
            <br />

   The licensee shall not use the information in a
                 manner that appears misleading nor present the
                 information in a distorted or incorrect
                 manner.

   Neither the licensor&apos;s nor other contributors&apos;

                 recommend or market the licensee or any
                 products or services using the information.

                 The licensor provides no warranties, including

                 information.

          <p>The licensor disclaims any liability for errors and
             defects associated with the information to the maximum
             extent permitted by law.</p>

            <p>The licensor shall not be liable for direct or indirect
             losses as a result of use of the information or in

          Guarantees regarding data quality and accessibility
            <br />

   This licence does not prevent the licensor from
                 issuing supplementary statements regarding
                 expected or intended data quality and
                 accessibility. Such statements shall be
                 regarded as indicative in nature and not
                 binding on the part of the licensor. The
                 disclaimers in Section 7 also apply in full
                 for such indicative statements. Based on
                 separate agreement, the licensor may provide
                 guarantees and distribute the information on
                 terms and conditions different from those set
                 forth in this licence.

                 this licence and some other work licensed
                 under a licence compatible by contract, such
                 distribution may be based on an appropriate
