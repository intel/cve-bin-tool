            Infringement. If any portion of, or functionality implemented by, the Original Code becomes
               the subject of a claim of infringement, Apple may, at its option: (a) attempt to procure
               the rights necessary for Apple and You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b)
               modify the Affected Original Code so that it is no longer infringing; or (c) suspend Your
               rights to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense and distribute the Affected Original Code
               until a final determination of the claim is made by a court or governmental administrative
               agency of competent jurisdiction and Apple lifts the suspension as set forth below. Such
               suspension of rights will be effective immediately upon Apple&apos;s posting of a notice
               to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for implementation of this License. Upon
               such final determination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the payment of a
               fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution
               of the Affected Original Code, Apple will lift the suspension of rights to the Affected
               Original Code by posting a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for
               implementation of this License. If Apple suspends Your rights to Affected Original Code,
               nothing in this License shall be construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to
               applicable law, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing code or
               independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third party.

            Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use,
               reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to
               destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All
               sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination
               shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should

               limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. Neither party will be liable to the
               other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating

               prejudice to any other right or remedy of either party.

            Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency,
               partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between You and Apple,
               and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance

            Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple&apos;s right to acquire,
               license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or
               products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,

              <br />

      develop, produce, market or distribute.

            Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this License will not be
               deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or
               regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
               drafter will not apply to this License.

            Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
               this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will
               be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
               intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and
               effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You
               from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
               enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and
               You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it
               that are in your possession or control.
