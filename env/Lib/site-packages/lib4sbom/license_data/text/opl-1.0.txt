               must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in
               Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable

               available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
               Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial
               Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means
               provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as

              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property

                 Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the
                 LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps
                 (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                 inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

              Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
                 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are

            Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,
               and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
               recipients&apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
               Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
               A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
               structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
               file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and
               to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
               recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
               behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that
               any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
               You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
               liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
               support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

            Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
               if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
               include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
               under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
               fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
               notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
               recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
               version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
               from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
               that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
               recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
               License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make
               it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
               alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
               Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
               Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute
               executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
               the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

            Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
               governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
               In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the

             or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the

             regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the
             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
