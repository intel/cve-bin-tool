          Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
             governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
             Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
             future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
             License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
             terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
             License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document

          Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
             made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic
             Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the

             available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
             least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
             available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
             remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
             party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the
             location of the Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of
             the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be

              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in

                 text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the
                 party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you
                 obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2,
                 You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall
                 take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably

             relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as
             a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
             Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
             as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may

             obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

             Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
             liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
             Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such

          Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
             the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
             notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
             of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
             of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
             version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating
             to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license
             of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
             compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
             not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the
             rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
             license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
             offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
             indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
             Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
          <p>If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in

             by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
             case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered

         prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they
         affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
         be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
         statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
         ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for
         review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted

         and to related Covered Code.</p>

            <p>Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to
         the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from
