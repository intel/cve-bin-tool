Version 6.6, April 2013
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>OPEN CASCADE releases and makes publicly available the source code of the software Open CASCADE
         Technology to the free software development community under the terms and conditions of this
         license.</p>

      <p>It is not the purpose of this license to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
         claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this license has the sole purpose of protecting the
         integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.
         Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
         system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if
         he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
         choice.</p>

      <p>Please read this license carefully and completely before downloading this software. By downloading,
         using, modifying, distributing and sublicensing this software, you indicate your acceptance to be
         bound by the terms and conditions of this license. If you do not want to accept or cannot accept for
         any reasons the terms and conditions of this license, please do not download or use in any manner this
         software.</p>
