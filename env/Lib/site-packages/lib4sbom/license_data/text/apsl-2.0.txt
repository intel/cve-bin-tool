              Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code
                 (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must
                 include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,

              Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each
                 Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth
                 herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does
                 not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple
                 and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity
                 based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
                 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole
                 responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
                 example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the
                 Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
                 Covered Code.

          Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this
             License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under
             this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your
             Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or
             controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and
             Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple&apos;s licenses

          Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
             by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such
             instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
             Code or any portion thereof.

          Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights,

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 6.</var>

             or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted
             herein (&quot;Additional Terms&quot;) to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
             may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple
             or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient&apos;s agreement that any such Additional
             Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and
             every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or
             such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

          Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time
             to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has
             been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under
             the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of
             any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the
             right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

          NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested,

             THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF

             AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
             AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND
             EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED
             CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE
             OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE
             COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN
             APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge
             that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
             navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure
             of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
             damage.

          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY
             CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
             OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY
             PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
             PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
             POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
             REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR
             CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple&apos;s
             total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
             this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

              Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use,
                 reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code. All
                 sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination
                 shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should
                 remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not
                 limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other
                 for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this
                 License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without
                 prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

              Government End Users. The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item&quot; as defined in FAR
                 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only

              Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency,
                 partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You,
                 Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly,

                 license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or
                 products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,

              Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this
                 License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.

              Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
                 this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will
                 be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
                 intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and
                 effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You
                 from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
                 enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and
                 You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it
                 that are in your possession or control.

                 hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts
