          <p>
This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to 
which it applies (the &quot;Work&quot;), either as-is or in modified form, for Your 
private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software 
from liability. 
          </p>

          <p>
This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties 
who receive the Work from you.  If any non-affiliated third party receives any 
part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You 
provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to 
independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss 
of data or capability due to your actions. 
          </p>

          <p>
The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

          <p>
In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of 
this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and 
conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that 
triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, 
as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by 
You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a &quot;Modified Work&quot;). 
Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.

places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the 
intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, 
the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the 
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You

              <p>
In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages

prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, 
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs incurred 
in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A

              <p>
Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any 
invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent 
of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid 
or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of 
this License will remain in full force and effect.
