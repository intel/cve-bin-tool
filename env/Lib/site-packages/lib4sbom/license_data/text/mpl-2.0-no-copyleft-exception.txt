              The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
                 any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this
                 License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
                 such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
                 basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
                 means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants
                 from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
                 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You
                 have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
                 become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

              If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim
                 (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a
                 Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted
                 to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this
                 License shall terminate.

                 (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your
                 distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

                 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
