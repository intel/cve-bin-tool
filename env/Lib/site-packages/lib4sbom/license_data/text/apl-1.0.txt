      <p>THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;LICENSE&quot;). ANY USE,

              <br />

      Recipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and each Subsequent
                 Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
                 representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is provided by any Initial
                 Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor that the Licensed Work does not
                 infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial
                 Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to
                 Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
                 property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed Works. As a condition to
                 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
                 sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
                 For example, without limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent
                 license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is
                 Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed
                 Work.

      A Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in
                 Executable form (an &quot;EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION&quot;) to any third party, under the terms of
                 Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable Distribution is made available
                 under and accompanied by a copy of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the

              The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the Licensed Work
                 making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be distributed on the same

              The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least
                 thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a
                 charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                 machine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable
                 Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
                 and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code form to any third

          SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS.
            <br />

      When a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, available to any Person
                 in Source Code form, it must be made available under this License and a copy of this
                 License must be included with each copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy
                 of the License is conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater
                 clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in
                 any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of
                 transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically
                 performing source distribution.

              REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE.
                <br />

      Each Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5 of Exhibit A is
                     included in each file of the Source Code for each Subsequent Work originating from
                     that particular Subsequent Contributor, if such notice is not already included in each
                     such file. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
                     due to its structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a
                     location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where a user would
                     be likely to look for such a notice.

              NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS.
                <br />

      Notwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally within its own
                     corporation or organization use the Licensed Work, including the Initial Work and
                     Subsequent Works, and make Modifications for internal use within Recipient&apos;s own
                     corporation or organization (collectively, &quot;INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS&quot;). The
                     Recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable
                     form, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such
                     internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All Internal Use
                     Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be
                     distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. If the
                     Recipient chooses to distribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third
                     Party, then the Recipient shall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such
                     Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent
                     Work originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such
                     instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made
                     available to third parties in accordance with the terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4
                     inclusive.

      This License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial Contributor, Subsequent

                     licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements.

      Any Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining any of
                     the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and may
                     distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. However, in any such case,
                     Distributor or Recipient (as the case may be) must make sure that the requirements of
                     this License are fulfilled for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work.

              Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial Contributor
                 also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) must cause each Subsequent Work created or
                 contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes,
                 in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Supplement File, that such Subsequent
                 Contributor made in the creation or contribution to that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement
                 File exists or no requirements are set out in Part 1 of the Supplement File, then there
                 are no requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they make

              The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier
                 requirements (in each case, the &quot;EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS&quot;) for documenting
                 changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement
                 File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so
                 that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the &quot;NEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS&quot;) for
                 documenting such changes.

                 a copy of this License (in each case, an &quot;Earlier LICENSED COPY&quot;) having the Earlier
                 Description Requirements may choose, with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to
                 comply with the Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements.
                 Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description Requirements, that Recipient
                 will, when thereafter distributing any copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a
                 Supplement File having a section entitled Part 1 that contains a copy of the New

              For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is to provide a mechanism
                 (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they make to the
                 Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement File shall not be
                 used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of this License
                 or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any Recipient, and
                 shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can
                 be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1 of
                 the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of any Supplement File
                 is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the
                 requirements for documenting changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work.

              An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions made by
                 Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is a
                 sample only and is not binding on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of
                 this Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in Part

                  As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional value
                     may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the
                     Initial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each
                     time an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a
                     program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial
                     Contributor&apos;s attribution information must occur (the &quot;ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION&quot;). The
                     Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For
                     greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File that the
                     above attribution requirement only applies to an executable program resulting from the
                     Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program dependent thereon. The intent is to
                     provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not
                     require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution
                     Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial Contributor; (b) a
                     word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or graphic provided
                     with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the &quot;ATTRIBUTION LIMITS&quot;).

                 users, business partners and the like. While this License is intended to facilitate
                 the commercial use of the Licensed Work, the Distributor who includes any of the
                 Licensed Work in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
                 create potential liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor
                 includes the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services,
                 such Distributor (&quot;COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
                 every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an &quot;INDEMNIFIED
                 PARTY&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;LOSSES&quot;) arising from
                 claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
                 Indemnified Party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
                 Distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a
                 commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The obligations in
                 this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
                 intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Party must:
                 (a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow
                 the Commercial Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor
                 in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party may
                 participate in any such claim at its own expense.

      Once the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by Initial Contributor
                 under a particular version of the License, Recipient may choose to continue to use it
                 under the terms of that version. However, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed
