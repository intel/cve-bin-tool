         <p>This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being granted certain rights under
         the terms of this License to Licensor&apos;s Software, whose Source Code You have access to, You are
         required to reciprocate by providing equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code
         of any Modifications, Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively
         defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under the terms of this License.
         In this fashion the available Source Code related to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for
         the benefit of everyone.</p>

         <p>Under the terms of this License You may:</p>

             injury or damages.

              Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source
                 Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as
                 You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic
                 Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its
                 Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain
                 available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the
                 date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
                 version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a

                 excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and

                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party&apos;s intellectual property
                     right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file
                     with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making
                     the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such
                     knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall
                     promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take
                     other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
                     to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been

              License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the

                 with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a

                 Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups,

                 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability
                 plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by

              Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being

                 license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your
                 Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict
                 with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the
                 conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission
                 will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

      Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of

         choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License

         to Licensed Software created under this License.

      Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for
         claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
         this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor.
         This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of
         Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against
         use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties
         and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and
         Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms
         of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed

          Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
             patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a
             Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to

             &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay
             Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed
             Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
             Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty
             and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
             litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and

             litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under
