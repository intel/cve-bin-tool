         <p>Introduction</p>

         <p>The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to
         the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType
         Project.</p>

         <p>This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit
         license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and
         makefiles, at the very least.</p>

         <p>This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all
         encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a
         consequence, its main points are that:</p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> o</var>
          We don&apos;t promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports.
             (`as is&apos; distribution)
        </li>
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> o</var>
          You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us.
             (`royalty-free&apos; usage)
        </li>
            
<li>
               <var class="replaceable-license-text"> o</var>
          You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you
             must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits&apos;)
        </li>
         
</ul>
         <p>We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in
         commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability
         related to The FreeType Project.</p>

         <p>Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this
         license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:</p>

         <p>&quot;&quot;&quot; Portions of this software are copyright Â© &lt;year&gt; The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All
         rights reserved. &quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

         <p>Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.</p>

          Definitions
          <p>Throughout this license, the terms `package&apos;, `FreeType Project&apos;, and `FreeType archive&apos; refer to
             the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and
             Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project&apos;, be they named as alpha, beta or final release.</p>

            <p>`You&apos; refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using&apos; is a generic term
             including compiling the project&apos;s source code as well as linking it to form a `program&apos; or
             `executable&apos;. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine&apos;.</p>

            <p>This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all
             source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original,
             unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a
             particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p>

            <p>The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner
             Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.</p>

          Redistribution
          <p>This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to
             use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and
             sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works
             thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted
             herein, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
               
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> o</var>
              Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT&apos;) unaltered; any
                 additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in
                 accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be
                 preserved in all copies of source files.
            </li>
               
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> o</var>
              Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based
                 in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage
                 you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn&apos;t
                 mandatory.
            </li>
            
</ul>
            <p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just
             the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be
             paid to us.</p>

          Advertising
          <p>Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for
             commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written
             permission.</p>

            <p>We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to
             this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project&apos;, `FreeType
             Engine&apos;, `FreeType library&apos;, or `FreeType Distribution&apos;.</p>

            <p>As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType
             Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the
             authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using,
             distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept
             all the terms of this license.</p>
