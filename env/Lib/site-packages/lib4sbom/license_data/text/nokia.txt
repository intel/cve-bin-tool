   The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms
                     of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version
                     of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
                     future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
                     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
                     not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
                     the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder.
                     However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights
                     described in Section 3.5.

              Availability of Source Code.
                <br />

   Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
                     Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
                     Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
                     to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
                     Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
                     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
                     after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available
                     to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
                     remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                     third party.

              Description of Modifications.
                <br />

   You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file
                     documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of
                     any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
                     derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and
                     including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                     ownership of the Covered Software.

                  Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
                     party&apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
                     by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file
                     with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim
                     and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
                     contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
                     available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL
                     file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                     (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                     inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been
                     obtained.

                     interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                     necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the
                     LEGAL file.

                     3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are
                     Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to

              Required Notices.
                <br />

   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is
                     not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
                     structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
                     directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created
                     one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
                     described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
                     for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights
                     relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
                     Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                     behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                     such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
                     and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability
                     incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
                     or liability terms You offer.

              Distribution of Executable Versions.
                <br />

   You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of
                     Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a
                     notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available
                     under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
                     fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
                     included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
                     collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered
                     Software. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or
                     ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
                     from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
                     License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
                     or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights
                     set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
                     different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
                     from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You
                     hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                     by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

                 COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR

             place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found
             void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which
             shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.</p>
