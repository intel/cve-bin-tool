                  statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                  indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
                  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer
                  in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                  Executable version or related documentation in which You

                  Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If
                  Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
                  party&apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise
                  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
                  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                  Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the
                  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
                  that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
                  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
                  available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
                  promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                  reasonably calculated to inform those who received
                  the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include
                  an application programming interface and Contributor
                  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                  necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
                  also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c)
                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
                  disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor
                  believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s
                  original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
                  rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

                  Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
                  A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible
                  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due
                  to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
                  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would
                  be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or
                  more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor
                  to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
                  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                  Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership
                  rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,
                  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
                  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                  Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
                  not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
                  You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
                  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
                  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

                  Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
                  Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
                  Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if
                  You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
                  of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
                  License, including a description of how and where You have
                  fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
                  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
                  version, related documentation or collateral in which You
                  describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code.
                  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
                  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
                  contain terms different from this License, provided that You
                  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that
                  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
                  limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code
                  version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
                  distribute the Executable version under a different license
                  You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
                  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
                  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree
                  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
                  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
                  such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

               <p>
                  This License represents the complete agreement concerning
                  subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
                  held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
                  only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
                  License shall be governed by German law provisions (except
                  to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
                  excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect
                  to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
                  of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business
                  in Federal Republic of Germany, any litigation relating
                  to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
                  the Federal Courts of the Federal Republic of Germany,
                  with the losing party responsible for costs, including
                  without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&apos;
                  fees and expenses. Any law or regulation which provides
                  that the language of a contract shall be construed
                  against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

                  under this License and You agree to work with Initial
                  Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
                  on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
                  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
