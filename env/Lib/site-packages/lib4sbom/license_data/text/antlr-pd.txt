      <p>We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or company may
         do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR,
         including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.</p>

      <p>We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for
         developing ANTLR. By &quot;credit&quot;, we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one
         of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact
         somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice
         tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
         headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue
         enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.</p>
