             direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
             License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

               if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
               Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You

             against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
