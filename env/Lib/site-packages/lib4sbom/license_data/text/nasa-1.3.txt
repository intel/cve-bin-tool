                    A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not
                     governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                     such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the
                     Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.

                    Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of
                     any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license
                     from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal
                     liability under U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be
                     required nor that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such
                     export license.
