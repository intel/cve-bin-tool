          Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
             right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must
             include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim
             and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
             contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described
             in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
             thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying RSV and appropriate mailing lists or
             newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Governed Code that new
             knowledge has been obtained. In the event that You are a Contributor, You represent that,
             except as disclosed in the LEGAL file, your Modifications are your original creations and, to
             the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to
             intellectual property claims) relating to your Modifications. You represent that the LEGAL
             file includes complete details of any license or other restriction associated with any part of
             your Modifications.

          Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
             this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&apos; rights
             relating to Governed Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name
             as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such
             notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such
             notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look
             for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
             indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Governed Code. However, You
             may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of RSV or any Contributor. You must make
             it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
             offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any
             liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
             liability terms You offer.

          Distribution of Executable Code Versions. You may distribute Governed Code in Executable Code
             form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Governed Code, and if
             You include a prominent notice stating that the Source Code version of the Governed Code is
             available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
             fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
             notice in an Executable Code version, related documentation or collateral in which You
             describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Governed Code. You may distribute the Executable
             Code version of Governed Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
             different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
             License and that the license for the Executable Code version does not attempt to limit or
             alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
             License. If You distribute the Executable Code version under a different license You must make
             it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
             not by RSV or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any
             liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

                 comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
                 the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
                 LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
                 Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
                 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able

          Limitation of Liability.
            <br />

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
                 CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RSV, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF GOVERNED
                 CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR
                 ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
                 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
                 FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
                 SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
                 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
                 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
                 LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
                 OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO
                 THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES ABOVE IS NOT VALID, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO
                 EVENT WILL RSV<var class="optional-license-text">&apos;</var>S LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND
                 DOLLARS ($5,000). THE GOVERNED CODE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
                 NUCLER, AVIATION, MASS TRANSIT OR MEDICAL APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER INHERENTLY
                 DANGEROUS APPLICATION THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE
                 OR MASS DESTRUCTION, AND YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RSV NOR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY
                 LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH USE OF THE GOVERNED CODE.

   The Governed Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
                 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software
                 documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
                 with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
                 U.S. Government End Users acquire Governed Code with only those rights set forth
                 herein.

          Miscellaneous.
            <br />

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
                 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
                 governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
                 provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The parties submit to
                 personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising
                 under or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the Federal Courts of the
                 Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.
                 The losing party shall be responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
                 costs and reasonable attorney<var class="optional-license-text">&apos;</var>s fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the
                 contrary herein, RSV may seek injunctive relief related to a breach of this Agreement
                 in any court of competent jurisdiction. The application of the United Nations
                 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
                 law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
                 against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

          Responsibility for Claims.

      <p>Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for
         damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
         on the number of copies of Governed Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing
         such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute
         responsibility on an equitable basis.</p>
