         <p>
            The licenses for most software are designed to take away
            your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the
            ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE specifically permits and encourages
            you to use this software, provided that you give the
            recipients all the rights that we gave you and make
            sure they can get the modifications of this software.

                     <p>
                        You must insert a prominent notice in each modified

                        as a whole to all third parties under the terms
                        of this License, such as by offering access to
                        copy the modifications from a designated place,
                        or distributing the modifications on a medium

                        If the modified fonts normally reads commands
                        interactively when run, you must cause it, when
                        started running for such interactive use in the most
                        ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
                        including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
                        that you provide a warranty) and that users may
                        redistribute the Font under these conditions, and
                        telling the user how to view a copy of this License.

                     <p>
                        These requirements apply to the modified work as
                        a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are
                        not derived from the Font, and can be reasonably
                        considered independent and separate works in themselves,
                        then this License and its terms, do not apply to
                        those sections when you distribute them as separate
                        works. Therefore, mere aggregation of another work
                        not based on the Font with the Font on a volume
                        of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
                        the other work under the scope of this License.

                  Condition Subsequent You may not copy, modify, sublicense,
                  or distribute the Font except as expressly provided under
                  this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
                  sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically
                  retroactively void your rights under this License.
                  However, parties who have received copies or rights
                  from you under this License will keep their licenses
                  valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

                  Acceptance You are not required to accept this License,
                  since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants
                  you permission to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
                  the Font. These actions are prohibited by law if you do
                  not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying,
                  sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate your
                  acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions.

                  Automatic Receipt Each time you redistribute the Font,
                  the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Font
                  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose
                  any further restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of
                  the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
                  enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

                  Contradiction If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
                  allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
                  (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
                  on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
                  that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
                  not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
                  you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
                  obligations under this License and any other pertinent
                  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
                  the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not
                  permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those
                  who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
                  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font.
               </p>

               <p>
                  If any portion of this section is held invalid or
                  unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
                  balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
                  as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

                  NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
                  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
                  BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING

                  IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
                  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
                  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT
                  IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

                  TO IN WRITING, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS,
                  OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE
                  THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY
                  DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR
                  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
                  USE THE FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF
                  SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS;
                  OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR OTHER
