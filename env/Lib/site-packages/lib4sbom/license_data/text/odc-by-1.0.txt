      <p>Preamble</p>

      <p>The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely
      share, modify, and use this Database subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.</p>

      <p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds
      all in the same database, for example), and so this license only governs the rights over the Database,
      and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use this license
      together with another license for the contents.</p>

      <p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not
      addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection
      rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other
      documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.</p>

      <p>------</p>

      <p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>

      <p>and</p>

      <p>You (as defined below)</p>

            <p>&quot;Convey&quot; - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the
             Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive

             user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a
             copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.</p>

             contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other
             material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be
             factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.</p>

            <p>&quot;Database&quot; - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or

            <p>&quot;Database Right&quot; - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (&quot;sui
             generis&quot;) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member
             states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part
             of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under
             Section 10.4.</p>

            <p>&quot;Derivative Database&quot; - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes
             any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the
             Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to,
             Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new
             Database.</p>

            <p>&quot;Extraction&quot; - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial

             incorporate.</p>

            <p>&quot;Produced Work&quot; - a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or
             sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or
             other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a

             previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has
             received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
             previous violation.</p>

               includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over
               the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law
               varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which
               is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the
               Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names

             Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection,
             privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than
             Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example,
             if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over
             individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license

             for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
             include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in
             the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
             known or created in the future.

               Database.
            <p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral

          This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial
             parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever,
             including creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see
             Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts
             of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part
             of the Contents.

             either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage.
             Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,
             non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a
             particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the

          Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable
             for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to
             anyone by any use under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by
             any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not
             limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as
             loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies even if
             the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically terminates this
             License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons
             who have received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
             Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this License will
             not have their licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this License
             or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will
             survive any termination of this License.

          Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this License,

<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> b.</var>
            Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably notified by

<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> c.</var>
            Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the first time
               You have received notice of violation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the
               violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

          Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Database under different
             license terms or to stop distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the Database
             under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw
             this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
             terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
             terminated as stated above.

             in this License in order to meet the terms of this License.
