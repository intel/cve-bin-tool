         <p>The &quot;Artistic License&quot;</p>

      </div>

      <p>Preamble</p>

      <p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the
         Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
         while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
         customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.</p>

      <p>Definitions:</p>

      <p>&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
         derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.</p>

      <p>&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
         in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.</p>

      <p>&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.</p>

      <p>&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&apos;re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.</p>

      <p>&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
         charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
         Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)</p>

      <p>&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
         involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
         same conditions they received it.</p>

            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 1.</var>
          You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this
             Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices
             and associated disclaimers.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 2.</var>
          You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain
             or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
             Standard Version.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 3.</var>
          You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a
             prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided
             that you do at least ONE of the following:
            
<ul style="list-style:none">
              
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> a)</var>
                place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such
                   as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
                   modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
                   Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
              </li>
              
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> b)</var>
                use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> c)</var>
                rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables,
                   which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard
                   executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
              </li>
              
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> d)</var>

            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 4.</var>
          You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that
             you do at least ONE of the following:
            
<ul style="list-style:none">
              
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> a)</var>
                distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with
                   instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
              </li>
              
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> b)</var>
                accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.
              </li>
              
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> c)</var>
                give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in
                   manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
                   Version.
              </li>
              
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> d)</var>

          You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any
             fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
             However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
             programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do
             not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package&apos;s
             interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form
             of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so
             embedded.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 6.</var>
          The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
             this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to
             whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
             If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called
             &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a binary executable image, then
             distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor
             shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent
             such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 7.</var>
          C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked
             into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by
             this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as
             in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would
             cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.
        </li>
        
<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 8.</var>
          Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the
             use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this
             Package&apos;s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use
             shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
