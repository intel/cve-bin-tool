                THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT
                (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SYBASE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR
                HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
                ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
                TO YOU. In no event shall Sybase&apos;s or any Contributor&apos;s total liability to You for all damages
                (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of five
                hundred dollars ($500.00).

             Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names &quot;Sybase&quot;
                or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Sybase (collectively &quot;Sybase Marks&quot;) or to
                any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor(&quot;Contributor Marks&quot;). No Sybase Marks
                or Contributor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code

                applicable.

                retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made
                by or on behalf of Sybase (&quot;Sybase Modifications&quot;), and such Sybase Modifications will not be

                this License or may choose not to license them at all.

                    reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy
                    all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the
                    Covered Code that have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any
                    termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond
                    the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8,
                    9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or

                    terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy
                    of any party.

                 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
                    joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among you, Sybase or any
                    Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication,

                 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Sybase&apos;s or any Contributor&apos;s right
                    to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology
                    or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,

                 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this
                    License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any
                    law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
                    the drafter will not apply to this License.

                 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this
                    License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be
                    enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of
                    the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b)
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
                    specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of
                    those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue
                    any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or
                    control.

                    this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Sybase
                    hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts
