         <p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>

         <p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other
         rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
         and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
         informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>

         <p>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the
         public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.
         Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the
         license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
         applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly
         mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other <var class="replaceable-license-text"> </var> material, or material
         used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors<var class="replaceable-license-text"> : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</var></p>

         <p>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public
         permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor&apos;s
         permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or
         limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
         permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
         the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have
         copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that
         all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
         respect those requests where reasonable. <var class="replaceable-license-text"> More considerations</var> for the public<var class="replaceable-license-text"> : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees</var></p>
