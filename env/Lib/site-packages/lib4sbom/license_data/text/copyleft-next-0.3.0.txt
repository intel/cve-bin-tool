            Distribution: General Conditions

            <p>You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform
            recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the
            applicable conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all
            Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they remain
            pertinent). &quot;Legal Notices&quot; means copyright notices, license notices,
            license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos,
            other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.</p>

        </li>

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 3.</var>
            Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

            <p>If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived
            Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
            licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
            separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work. You may
            additionally license the Derived Work under the GPL, so that the
            recipient may further Distribute the Derived Work under either this
            License or the GPL.</p>

        </li>

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 4.</var>
            Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility

            <p>When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further
            restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under
            this License. This condition is not excused merely because such
            restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations
            extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a
            third party).</p>

            <p>However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material
            governed by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the
            release date of this License, provided that Your Distribution complies
            with such other license.</p>

        </li>

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 5.</var>
            Conditions for Distributing Object Code

            <p>You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that
            you accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding
            Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary
            means of providing network access to source code.</p>

            <p>If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
            storage medium (&quot;Product&quot;), the Corresponding Source must be available
            through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent
            Distribution of the Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product
            itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made
            available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also comply
            with the first paragraph of this section.</p>

            <p>Each recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended third-party
            beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right
            to enforce its terms.</p>

        </li>

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 6.</var>
            Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

            <p>If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or
            modification of a Covered Work (a &quot;Patch&quot;), and no explicit licensing
            terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to
            the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not
            negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.</p>

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 7.</var>
            Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

            <p>If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than
            a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
            License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the
            Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no
            longer subject to the conditions in sections 2 through 5.</p>

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 8.</var>
            Copyleft Sunset

            <p>The conditions in sections 2 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen
            years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work
            under this License.</p>

        </li>

<li>
            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 9.</var>
            Pass-Through

            <p>When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
            a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.</p>

        </li>

            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 10.</var>
            Termination
            <p>Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You</p>

                    such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or
                </li>

                    <var class="replaceable-license-text"> b)</var>
                    initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
                    declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
                    alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes
                    any patent.
                </li>
            
</ul>

            <p>Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
            Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the
            rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to
            this License.</p>

            <p>To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary
            merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.</p>

            <var class="replaceable-license-text"> 11.</var>
            Later License Versions

            <p>The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
            designated by a distinguishing version number (&quot;Later Versions&quot;).
            Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works
            under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later
            Version.</p>

            No Warranty

            <p>My Work is provided &quot;as-is&quot;, without warranty. You bear the risk
            of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
            Distributor of My Work excludes the implied warranties of title,
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
            non-infringement.</p>

            Limitation of Liability

            <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any
            Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages
            whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
            consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort
            (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor
            knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.</p>

            Severability

            <p>The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
            does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
            this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent
            necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>

            <p>&quot;Corresponding Source&quot; of a Covered Work in Object Code form means (i)

            Works (other than those provided in compliance with (ii)) that were

            required. The following are not Derived Works: (i) Mere Aggregation;
            (ii) a mere reproduction of My Work; and (iii) if My Work fails to
