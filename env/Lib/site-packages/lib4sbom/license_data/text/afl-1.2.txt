         <p>This Academic Free License applies to any original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner
         (the &quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the
         Original Work:</p>

         <p>Licensed under the Academic Free License version 1.2</p>

      </div>

      <p>Grant of License. Licensor hereby grants to any person obtaining a copy of the Original Work (&quot;You&quot;) a
         world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license (1) to use, copy,
         modify, merge, publish, perform, distribute and/or sell copies of the Original Work and derivative
         works thereof, and (2) under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
         the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original
         Work and derivative works thereof, subject to the following conditions.</p>

      <p>Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all
         copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
         notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must
         cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
         reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p>

      <p>Exclusions from License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the
         Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
         products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor.</p>

      <p>Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work is
         owned by the Licensor or that the Original Work is distributed by Licensor under a valid current
         license from the copyright owner. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence,
         the Original Work is provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either
         express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
         or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
         YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original
         Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.</p>

      <p>Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
         negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,
         indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
         License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.
         This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
         Licensor&apos;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do
         not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
         limitation may not apply to You.</p>

      <p>License to Source Code. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making
         modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor
         hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each
         copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
         obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
         reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as
         Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that
         information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to
         the Original Work.</p>

      <p>Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer
         exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging
         that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any license containing this &quot;Mutual
         Termination for Patent Action&quot; clause infringes any patent claims that are essential to use that
         software.</p>

      <p>Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this
         License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by
         You.</p>

      <p>This license is Copyright (C) 2002 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.</p>

      <p>Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without modification. This license
         may not be modified without the express written permission of its copyright owner.</p>
