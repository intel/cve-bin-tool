            My &quot;symlinks&quot; utility pre-dates the &quot;open source licensing&quot;
            fad by a number of years. Just to clarify, this is 100%
            freeware, written entirely by myself. The intent is to use
            it to detect missing/obsolete symlink targets on an installed
            distro, before creating the &quot;gold&quot; (or &quot;final&quot;) release discs.
