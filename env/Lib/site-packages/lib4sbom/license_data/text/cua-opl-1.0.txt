                Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s
                   intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
                   Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the

                   making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
                   Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described
                   in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                   makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                   mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
                   Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                 it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                 then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user

                 support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
                 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the

                 ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
                 License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the

                 the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
                 terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
                 any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for
                 any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
                 terms You offer.

                 case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
                 Code.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You
                 must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
                 (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
                 included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
                 distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
                 regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
                 skill to be able to understand it.

          MISCELLANEOUS.
            <br />

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
                 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
                 governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
                 provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
                 disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
                 registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
                 this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
                 Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
                 with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
                 and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and expenses. The application of the United
                 Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
                 excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
                 be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

                 such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
                 deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
