          The version number will be modified as follows:
          
<ul style="list-style:none">
               
<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> a.</var>
              The first 3 components of the version number (i.e &lt;number&gt;.&lt;number&gt;.&lt;number&gt;)
                 will remain unchanged.

<li>
                  <var class="replaceable-license-text"> b.</var>
              A new component will be appended to the version number to indicate the modification level. The
                 form of this component is up to the author of the modifications.

        <p>This is an exerpt from an email I recieved from the original author, allowing xinetd as maintained by me
           (Rob Braun), to use the higher version numbers:</p>

        <p>I appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified in the copyright. But I did not
           mean them to last as long as they did.</p>

        <p>So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N &gt;= 3) version string for future xinetd versions that you
           release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that would only create confusion. Naming the
           next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.</p>
