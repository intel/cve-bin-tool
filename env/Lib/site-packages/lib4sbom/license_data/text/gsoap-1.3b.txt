                        <p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
                         possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                         then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a
                         user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
                         Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                         Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                         Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights relating to
                         Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
                         You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
                         any Contributor.</p>

                        Distribution of Executable Versions.
                        <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                         3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version
                         of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
                         terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
                         of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
                         limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights
                         set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
                         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
                         License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If
                         you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you
                         must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials

                         terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
