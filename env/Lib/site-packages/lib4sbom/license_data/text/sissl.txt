                 applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. Your license for

                 Version. In the event that the Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to
                 publish either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from implementation of
                 Your Modifications and a reference implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your

              Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If
                 it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                 then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
                 would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
                 add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
                 this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or
                 ownership rights relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
                 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your

                 Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
                 indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
                 the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of
                 warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

              Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source
                 form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code,
                 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is
                 available under the terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
                 notice in an Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You
                 describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the Executable
                 and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
                 choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                 compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source
                 versions under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
                 differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby
                 agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
                 as a result of any such terms You offer.

                 such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                 Original Code.

             or all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)

             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file

          MISCELLANEOUS
          <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
             License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
             make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent
             applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
             disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
             business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
             the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in
             Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
             limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and expenses. The application of the United
             Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
             regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
             not apply to this License.</p>
