# Fuzz testing for cve-bin-tool

We're in the early stages of doing fuzz testing on cve-bin-tool, with the goal
of improving our input validation and finding potential crashes before users
do.

If you want to try it out, I have made a very simple setup for the [Atheris
fuzzer](https://github.com/google/atheris) in `fuzz/fuzz_main.py`

To install Atheris, use `pip install atheris` or you can use the fuzz-requirements.txt file I've provided (`pip install -U -r fuzz-requirements.txt`).

Once you have atheris installed, you can run the main fuzzing script yourself
from the main cve-bin-tool directory using

```console
python -m fuzz.fuzz_main
```

We recommend that you use a separate VM or machine for fuzz testing, as fuzzing involves sending a lot of bad data into a program and can produce unpredictable results.  This could include damage to data on your system.
